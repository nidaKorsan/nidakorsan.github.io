<p>In my second year in CSE, I joined the Robotics and Automation club in my university and as a team, we decided to attend to CanSat Competition which is orginazed by American Astronautical Society and sponsored by U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, NASA and more organizations.</p>

<p>The consept of the competition design-build-launch a space-type system, following the given requirements. This space-type system is called a “<em>CanSat</em>” (short for <strong>Can</strong> <strong>Sat</strong>telite). Every year the mission changes. In the year our team had attended, we were expected to design an auto-gyro/passive helicopter recovery descent control system of a science payload and a container to protect the science payload as it is deployed from the rocket.</p>

<p>During this mission we were expected to provide and transmit data which include measurements for altitude using air pressure, external temperature, battery voltage, GPS position, pitch and roll and auto-gyro/ passive helicopter recovery blade spin rate to a ground control device. When the science payload lands, the software loaded should stop all telemetry and activate an audio beacon which is located on the science payload.</p>

<p>I was responsible for designing the flow of flight software that is needed for the quests listed above and develop this software.</p>

<p>We decided to use Teensy 3.6 board to control and manage the sensors needed. Thr reasons behind choosing this board are that it is light and small, well-priced and that it has as sufficient memory and speed. For telemetry we used XBEE radios.</p>

<p>As development environment I used Visual Basic, Arduino IDE and XCTU IDE.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Necessary raw data will be received from various sensors.</li>
  <li>Data will be sent to MCU (micro controller unit).</li>
  <li>Later on this data will be saved on an SD card.</li>
  <li>Through telemetry, the data packages will be sent to the ground station via XBEE radios.</li>
</ul>

<p>During development of this piece of software I did lots of research to get the idea behind using sensors efficiently, communication protocols and using XBEE radios for telemetry.</p>

<p>Learning how to use sensors and communicating with them was a new thing for me. For some of the sensors I used some libraries that are developed by PJRC developers. For the communication between the sensors and MCU, I used I2C protocol. The advantages of using I2C protocol are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>maintains low pin/signal count even with numerous devices on the bus</li>
  <li>adapts to the needs of different slave devices</li>
  <li>readily supports multiple masters</li>
</ul>

<p>Figuring out how the sensors are connected, how to test them and connecting them to each other took time but in the end I could manage to work all of them harmoniously.</p>
